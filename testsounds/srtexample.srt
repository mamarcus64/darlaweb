1
00:00:07,019 --> 00:00:09,091
the

2
00:00:09,091 --> 00:00:11,700
I'll

3
00:00:12,519 --> 00:00:14,581
of

4
00:00:15,139 --> 00:00:19,228
Ste

5
00:00:20,029 --> 00:00:26,077
the ground ball room

6
00:00:26,509 --> 00:00:31,586
so we've got a good time life

7
00:00:32,279 --> 00:00:39,279
yeah

8
00:00:40,006 --> 00:00:47,006
school

9
00:00:49,043 --> 00:00:50,101
we come into this world

10
00:00:51,001 --> 00:00:54,059
mean clue innate abilities to learn to
interact

11
00:00:54,059 --> 00:00:58,067
with you other ascension be what

12
00:00:58,067 --> 00:01:02,090
pressured to interact with other people
by writing little messages to them

13
00:01:02,009 --> 00:01:05,090
be a real pain

14
00:01:06,071 --> 00:01:09,128
and that's how we interact with
computers it's much easier just to talk

15
00:01:10,028 --> 00:01:10,064
to them

16
00:01:10,064 --> 00:01:15,403
is just so much easier here if the
computers can understand what we think

17
00:01:15,979 --> 00:01:19,960
and polite you need really good speech
recognition

18
00:01:19,096 --> 00:01:23,194
the first speech recognition system was
developed by Bell Laboratories in 1952

19
00:01:24,094 --> 00:01:27,163
it can only recognize numbers spoken by
one person

20
00:01:28,009 --> 00:01:31,098
in the nineteen seventies karnicki
nanking out harpy system which was able

21
00:01:31,899 --> 00:01:33,910
to recognize over 1,000 words

22
00:01:34,009 --> 00:01:37,410
and could recognize different
pronunciations the same word

23
00:01:37,041 --> 00:01:40,094
tomato Moda speech recognition continued

24
00:01:40,094 --> 00:01:44,129
eighties the introduction hidden Markov
model which used in more mathematical

25
00:01:45,029 --> 00:01:47,032
approach to analyzing sound waves

26
00:01:47,032 --> 00:01:50,871
and led to many the breakthroughs we
have today you're taking in very raw

27
00:01:51,159 --> 00:01:52,164
audio waveforms

28
00:01:52,659 --> 00:01:56,280
like you got from mike von on your phone
or whatever

29
00:01:56,028 --> 00:01:59,112
we chop it into small pieces price

30
00:02:00,012 --> 00:02:03,051
to identify which phoneme West spoken

31
00:02:03,051 --> 00:02:07,059
in that loss d-sub speech for phoneme is
the kind of primitive unit for

32
00:02:07,059 --> 00:02:07,898
expressing

33
00:02:08,429 --> 00:02:11,750
were ha I

34
00:02:11,075 --> 00:02:16,172
home I'll tell and Mandy Moore won a
stage those together into

35
00:02:17,072 --> 00:02:20,086
likely words like Palo Alto speech
recognition

36
00:02:20,086 --> 00:02:23,150
today is quite good in transcribing what
you've said what's the weather like to

37
00:02:24,005 --> 00:02:24,010
pick a

38
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:28,067
you can talk about troubles you can talk
about your contacts

39
00:02:28,067 --> 00:02:32,246
like where can I get pizza journalistic
how tall is Apple tower

40
00:02:32,849 --> 00:02:35,941
our we've made tremendous improvements
very quickly

United States Chester and there was a

43
00:02:42,095 --> 00:02:46,122
where's he from years ago you had to be
an engineer in Iraq with computers

44
00:02:47,022 --> 00:02:50,931
I'll I mean today everybody can interact
1p know if

45
00:02:51,129 --> 00:02:54,720
pill in the infancy is the understanding
we need a far more sophisticated

46
00:02:54,072 --> 00:02:55,151
language understanding model

47
00:02:56,051 --> 00:02:59,147
understands what the standards means
missed in a very long way from having

48
00:03:00,047 --> 00:03:07,047
did 0 the

49
00:03:07,078 --> 00:03:10,109
our ability to use language in wanted
the in home

50
00:03:11,009 --> 00:03:15,098
chins it's one of the things

51
00:03:15,098 --> 00:03:19,102
company from one generation to another
figuring out

52
00:03:20,038 --> 00:03:24,071
about how the system language worms you
know that seems like a really easy

53
00:03:24,071 --> 00:03:25,126
problems

54
00:03:26,026 --> 00:03:31,027
me one it's really hard but that every
baby has managed by the time they're

55
00:03:31,036 --> 00:03:35,039
years old %uh %um to our yell

56
00:03:35,039 --> 00:03:38,048
I'll man's

57
00:03:38,048 --> 00:03:42,048
language is extremely complex and
sophisticated from the semantics irony

58
00:03:42,048 --> 00:03:45,124
strong accent facial expressions human
emotion is at Sparta

59
00:03:46,024 --> 00:03:51,073
how we communicate humor I have to be
careful not to offend the diameter

60
00:03:51,073 --> 00:03:54,077
language has so many different layers
and that's why it's such a difficult

61
00:03:54,077 --> 00:03:55,084
problem

62
00:03:55,084 --> 00:03:59,096
the present the human brain and the
learning outcomes in human brains

63
00:03:59,096 --> 00:04:02,147
far far better things I language
understanding and this to a better

64
00:04:03,047 --> 00:04:03,056
package

65
00:04:04,037 --> 00:04:07,081
to whether or not we replicate exactly
with the brain does

66
00:04:07,081 --> 00:04:10,162
I to understand language and to
understand speech

67
00:04:11,062 --> 00:04:16,131
is still a questions

68
00:04:17,031 --> 00:04:20,037
for many many years 0 we believe

69
00:04:20,037 --> 00:04:23,090
good neural network should work better
Rooney

70
00:04:23,009 --> 00:04:26,051
dumb existing technology was basically
just take a look at home

71
00:04:27,032 --> 00:04:30,053
and then in 2009 to my students

72
00:04:30,053 --> 00:04:33,075
with little input from me goaded

73
00:04:33,075 --> 00:04:36,111
working better own first time it just
went a little bit better but then it was

74
00:04:37,011 --> 00:04:40,056
obvious that this could be developed
somewhat much better

75
00:04:40,056 --> 00:04:43,059
the brain has these millions in your
arms all computing power

76
00:04:43,086 --> 00:04:47,145
and all the knowledge in the brain
within the strength to the connection

77
00:04:47,919 --> 00:04:48,400
between your

78
00:04:48,004 --> 00:04:51,027
what I mean by neural net is something
mince

79
00:04:51,063 --> 00:04:55,071
simulating a conventional computer but
is designed to work

80
00:04:55,071 --> 00:04:58,156
in very very rough in the same way as
the bread

81
00:04:59,056 --> 00:05:02,075
so until quite recently people go
speeches by

82
00:05:02,075 --> 00:05:05,112
and engineering they look good sign
waving

83
00:05:06,012 --> 00:05:10,041
did for reanalysis I may try to figure
out what features should we feed to the

84
00:05:10,041 --> 00:05:11,047
pattern recognition system

85
00:05:11,047 --> 00:05:14,140
nothing on your own networks as they
learn their own features in particular

86
00:05:15,004 --> 00:05:19,143
they can on features and then they can
and features a few chosen and features a

87
00:05:19,539 --> 00:05:20,580
pink jersey features

88
00:05:20,058 --> 00:05:22,147
my sleep with huge improvement in speed
range

89
00:05:23,047 --> 00:05:26,047
but you can also use them for language
understanding past

90
00:05:26,047 --> 00:05:30,066
and the way you do this is you represent
words

91
00:05:30,066 --> 00:05:33,855
be in very high-dimensional spaces we
can now deal with analogies

92
00:05:34,449 --> 00:05:38,449
where would his representatives and
mister numbers so for example if i take

93
00:05:38,449 --> 00:05:39,110
me

94
00:05:39,011 --> 00:05:42,053
mister hundred-numbers the represents
patterns

95
00:05:42,053 --> 00:05:46,059
and I subtract from it brings and I had
to indigent

96
00:05:47,013 --> 00:05:50,232
and if I look at the numbers I'll the
closest thing

97
00:05:50,349 --> 00:05:54,384
is unlisted numbers eruptions romel for
by first converting went into these

98
00:05:54,699 --> 00:05:56,370
numbers using your own anymore

99
00:05:56,037 --> 00:05:59,068
with you can actually do this and
logical reasoning

100
00:05:59,068 --> 00:06:02,107
the new I predict that in the next five
years

101
00:06:03,007 --> 00:06:06,093
would come clean these big did you know
that works with the new learning

102
00:06:06,093 --> 00:06:07,202
algorithms

103
00:06:08,039 --> 00:06:12,910
again to give us much meddling regions

104
00:06:12,091 --> 00:06:15,160
when we started out we thought that
things like chap

105
00:06:15,979 --> 00:06:18,979
for nap now ranks or our lodging

106
00:06:18,979 --> 00:06:22,690
those are going to be the things that
were really hard on back hard I mean we

107
00:06:22,069 --> 00:06:24,418
can end up with the machine actually can

108
00:06:25,039 --> 00:06:28,520
do chats as well as the ground after
camp lejeune the things that we thought

109
00:06:28,052 --> 00:06:29,231
were gonna be easy

110
00:06:29,699 --> 00:06:33,550
for computer system like understanding
language

111
00:06:33,055 --> 00:06:37,474
things have turned out to be incredibly
hard I can't even imagine

112
00:06:37,969 --> 00:06:41,960
a though we've done it the moment might
get just because there are so many

113
00:06:41,096 --> 00:06:44,205
is this puzzled that around songs both

114
00:06:45,069 --> 00:06:49,116
from a science my nephew on as well as
come from a technical

115
00:06:49,539 --> 00:06:54,000
nationwide there's a lot of unknowns
those are the great revolution sir

116
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:57,056
not just when been a little with what we
already know about when we discover

117
00:06:57,056 --> 00:06:59,405
something completely new and unexpected

118
00:06:59,909 --> 00:07:02,984
I think once you kind ever in the
ballpark give him another

119
00:07:03,659 --> 00:07:07,560
that will be the pretty remarkable

120
00:07:07,056 --> 00:07:12,064
the I'll

121
00:07:13,036 --> 00:07:13,061
ok
